package com.example.yair

/*
Here we are accessing the class, sleeping for 1 second, and then accessing ObjectTest.

This will output: Companion Object Init

Then after a second: Object Init Object Method

Conclusion:
We can see that while they are similar, they have some pretty big differences.
companion object has these characteristics:
Unable to stand by itself
Is loaded with the class

object has these characteristics:
Able to stand by itself
Can be used as an expression
Used for anonymous inner class equivalent
Lazy


A companion object is not part of an instance of a class. You can't access members from a companion object, just like in Java you can't access members from a static method.

Instead, don't use a companion object:

    PersonA.myName = "yair"
    PersonA.callMe()

    Test.ObjectTest.objectMethod()
